#Discussion Forum
Software Development doesn’t have that much
literature to help us during errors, logical failures
etc., github.com, stackoverflow.com and other online
websites doesn’t provide a specific solution to your
problem. At IOSD we plan to work as a team helping
each other encounter such problems.
